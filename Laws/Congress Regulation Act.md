# Congress Regulation Act

## Part 1: Voting Math.

Votes may be Yes, No, or Abstain.

Abstain votes are not counted when calculating whether a simple majority (one more yes vote than no vote) or supermajority (one more yes vote than 2/3 of all yes/no votes) is present.

The current CP may vote on proposals.

## Part 2: The Security Council.
The Security Council (SeCo) is an entity tasked with making legislation during situations where there are no Congress Elections.. 
Membership of the Security Council is determined after the Congress Elections. Members should be selected based on their activity and their capability to take a decision with only the nation's interests in mind.

No later than 72 hours after the (world-wide) Congress elections results are made public (3 p.m. CET on the 30th of the month), the 5 parties with the highest number of members (measured at the time of publication of the election results) each must appoint an eBelgian citizen as a member of the Security Council. If the deadline has passed, no further appointments will be accepted.

All appointments to the SeCo must be posted in the PM of the outgoing Congress, by either the Party President or another party representative.
A party may change the appointed SeCo member only if the originally appointed member changes parties or is removed from the SeCO. The party may choose not to appoint a new member.
In addition to the members selected by political parties, the Country President is also a SeCo-member.

A SeCo member may be removed after a successful SeCo vote or when the SeCo member no longer holds eBe citizenship.

Once the majority of the SeCo members has agreed on a proposal, it will become law.

The full Congressional body reserves the right to hold a vote to repeal any legislation enacted by the SeCo with a simple majority vote.
