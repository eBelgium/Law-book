# Bank Manager Law
Congress officially recognises the Bank Managers or BM as a method used by the eBelgian government to keep the treasury safe from an elected PTO-CP. The eBelgian government determines the way that the Bank Managers are used.

The BM need to follow swiftly all requests from the CP or his/her representative (like MoF) to transfer BEF/gold. The only legit reason to delay and/or refuse a transfer is if the BM honestly believes that the CP is part of an PTO and the BM immediatly warns the community by publishing an article.

Addition and removal of BM is determined by the current CP.

*Note: Current BM are Olv007*
