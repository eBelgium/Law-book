All immigration requests shall be reviewed the Minister of National Security, to be appointed by the current President of eBelgium. 
The Minister of National Security will be added to every Congress PM and inform the members about new requests. Congress members may comment about these requests and vouch for any potential citizens who are known to them. Within 48 hours, sooner if they feel they have sufficient information, the MoNS will post his advice to accept or reject the request. If the advice is to reject, a reason will be given.

According to game mechanics, Congress members may accept any request. However, on the 24th of each month, the MoNS shall make a report, published in the Government Newspaper, showing who made requests, the advice of the MoNS, and, if the citizenship was given, who gave it and from what party. This report should not include further comment, positive or negative, about these cases.
