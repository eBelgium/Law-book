# The National Security Act

## 1. State of Emergency

**a** - A State of Emergency will automatically exist when Belgium is the victim of a successful PTO of the Presidency and/or Congress. It can also be declared when the government deems that the sovereignty of eBelgium is being threatened by a PTO.

**b** - A State of Emergency may only be declared by the president or in his absence the vice president. 

**c** - In the case of a successful PTO of the Presidency Congress (or the Emergency Congress in the case of a simultaneous PTO of Congress) may either pronounce the Vice President as interim Country President or elect an interim Country President who will institute an Emergency Government or Government in Exile which shall remain in office until replaced by a legitimate in-game election of a new Country President.

**d** - A State of Emergency will remain in effect until the crisis has passed or for a maximum of 168 hours. An extension of the State of War may be declared after the 168 hours if required.

## 2. Anti-PTO Procedures

**a** - A Political Take Over (PTO) is when a highly organized group originating outside of Belgium, often with the aid of multi-accounts or cheating, attempts to gain political power in Belgium through victories in elections. A Political Take Over is defined by, but not restricted to, the attempt to restrain Belgiumâ€™s autonomy, oppress the historical citizenry and culture, and make her directly subordinate to another eNation(s).

**b** - As the approval of Citizenship Requests are a matter of National Security due to possible Political Take Over (PTO) attempts, the President or the person in charge of security will be allowed to close Immigration. When immigration is closed no congressman is allowed to give anybody Belgian Citizenship.

**c** - The Minister who is in charge of security has the responsibility to formulate procedures to assist in the prevention of any possible Political Take Over (PTO) of the Presidency, Congress, or any Political Party in consultation with the President, Congress, and the Party Presidents respectively.

**d** - Anti-PTO procedures could include the use of blocking candidates, forum pre-votes, etc. while maintaining democracy to as large an extent as is possible under the specific circumstances or level of threat.

**e** - Each Political Party is entitled to an Election Monitor to liaise with the Minister who is in charge of security and oversee the Anti-PTO procedures being implemented. The agreement of 2 or more Election Monitors will be required for any objection, appeal or complaint to be valid. Procedures for selecting a Party Election Monitor are to be determined by the party concerned.

**f** - Anti-PTO procedures may include a regular dummy proposal to Impeach the President at a strategic time during each Presidential term so as to effectively be able to impeach any PTO President as soon as possible after the Presidential elections. The Minister who is in charge of security will ask Congress to propose this dummy Impeachment in-game at least 24 hours before it being required but in this case no Discussion or Vote will be required before proceeding to an in-game vote.

**g** - A Debate or Vote will not be required during a State of Emergency in which case the Impeachment of a rogue or PTO President may immediately proceed to an in-game vote.

## 3. Amendments to this Act

Amendments to this Act can be proposed by any member of Congress and will be subject to the same Proposal Debate and Vote requirement as any other proposal, but will require a majority vote of more than 50% to pass.
