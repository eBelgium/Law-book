# Freedom of Information and State Secrets Act (FOISSA)
**a**) The FOIA is premised on transparency, democracy, and honesty. The FOIA ensures that the community of eBelgium has access to past discussions that were once classified as a "State Secret". Once discussions in the private Congress PM have lost their "State Secret" status (see **b**)), they will be made available for viewing to the public by the Chairman of Congress designated with the [FOIA] tag in an article published in the official newspaper of the eBelgian Congress

**b**) All discussions in the Congress PM are designated secrets of the state and therefore protected from disclosure by this act unless they are concerned with information that is already publicly available.

**c**) A simple majority is required to amend or repeal this law.
